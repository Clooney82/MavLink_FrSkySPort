These files are the same required for normal operation of the Taranis X9D v.2.0.12

These are the same files as a standard OpenTX sound pack has, but were generated on a Mac OSX using the Ava TTS Voice. You can disregard these and keep your existing sound pack files.

The readme.md files can be safely ignored :) and not copied to the microSD Card.
