These files are the same required for normal operation of the Taranis X9D v.2.0.12

These include the same files as a standard OpenTX sound pack has, but were generated on a Mac OSX using the Ava TTS Voice. You can disregard these and keep your existing sound pack files.

The readme.md files can be safely ignored :) and not copied to the microSD Card.

The additional files required to have this script working are present, and are MSG###.wav, battc.wav, att.wav, SDISAR.wav, SARM.wav, ALFM#.wav, AVFM#.wav, FSMM.wav, ER#.wav where the # symbol represents numbers.
